Triggers

Connect to sql server:

-------------------------------------------------------
Triggers

It is a special type of stored procedures which are fired automatically.
Because, they donot return any thing like stored procedures.




1) create trigger


triggers are fired/called automatically when a condition becomes true.


Similar to Constraints, errors are automatically.

When writing triggers:
1) event when the trigger must be fired
2) what you want to do when the event fires/ trigger condtion becomes true

Types of Triggers:

1) Data Definition Language triggers: create,alter,drop


2) Data Manipulation Language Triggers:Insert /Updating /Deleting data from the table/s then called as DML triggers.
Stored Procedures that do DML operations, then we can use DML triggers.

     
a)After/For Clause in DML Triggers: After the SQL Server finishes the work of Insert/Update/Delete successfully, then you want to execute some code,
							------
such codes/logic is written in body
After Insert
After Update
After Delete

Before the data goes into the table AFTER the insert statement, the data is recorded in the memory of SQL server when a trigger is written on that table.
The memory maintains a table called as "INSERTED" for all the inserted statements before they go to the table, and when the data is seen/inserted in the table
successfully that memory table is cleared.
When the data is DELETED then the "DELETED" memory table is used.




b) Instead Of/Before :Before the SQL Server starts the work of Insert/Update/Delete successfully, then you want to execute some code,
		      -------		    ------			
such codes/logic is written in body.
Instead of Insert
Instead of Update
Instead of Delete




3) Logon Triggers

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenarios for Triggers:

1) you have a table that changes frequently, now you want to know how many times and when the changes take place.
In this case we create a History Table to record the old data & the new data changes in the data

Emp_test
Empid Ename
(int)  (varchar(20))
  1        Anita
  2        Sumati


Table:emp_History

08-11-2023                   Insert         -                      2           -                  Suma              dbo
08-11-2023                   Update         2                      2           Suma                  Sumati       dbo
08-11-2023                   Delete         2                      -           Sumati                  -           dbo

Syntax:
create trigger trigname
After/InsteadOf Insert/Update/Delete
on tablename
as
begin
//logic
end;

create trigger trigname
after Insert on tablename
as 
begin
//logic
end

Functions and Procedures 
repeatative work
task is performed and don't caluclations/output from it, it just makes a effect on the table/s in the database ---Procedure
task is performed and calculations are done and the output of the calculcation is expected ----- function

1) create function dbo.CalculateTotalAmt
.........


2) Execute the function: select dbo.CalculateTotalAmt(10248)
-------------------------------------------------------------
1) create procedure dbo.InsertStudentData
.........


2) Exec/Execute dbo.InsertStudentData(12,'ABC')

Call them to get their functionality
